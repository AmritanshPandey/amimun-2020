                                    <p> Welcome to Amity International Model United Nations Club!<br>

                                        Cognizant of the Amity vision towards holistic and overall development, the
                                        AMIMUN
                                        Club is part of the continuous effort to accomplish this goal. We seek to
                                        produce
                                        leaders of the highest order, by means of engaging them with MUNs as a tool for
                                        self-development.
                                        <br>

                                        MUNs over the past decade have managed to transform into a mainstream
                                        extra-curricular activity. The primary reason behind this widespread acceptance
                                        is
                                        the amount of rigour involved; as MUNs are not only verbal debates but a clash
                                        of
                                        core ideas and their application to the real world. A peculiar aspect of MUNs is
                                        the
                                        focus on actionable change, something I believe is especially important as it
                                        lays a
                                        clear focus on problem-solving instead of abstract, principled debate. This
                                        focus on
                                        problem-solving is what sets MUNs apart from other activities since MUNs
                                        actively
                                        incentivizes the creation of a wide knowledge base and develops clarity of
                                        action. I
                                        believe MUNs to be intrinsically valuable as an activity for any student looking
                                        to
                                        improve their public speaking skills, knowledge base or their approach towards
                                        solving real-world problems.

                                        The AMIMUN Club takes up the initiative to promote the culture of MUNing within
                                        the
                                        confines of Amity University, by actively engaging students via means of
                                        Training
                                        Sessions and Intra-MUNs alike. Possessing one of the largest student member
                                        bodies,
                                        the AMIMUN Club has grown leaps and bounds since its inception in 2012. Not only
                                        is
                                        this stellar growth a sign of MUNs being accepted widely among the student body,
                                        but
                                        also of a successful effort to enrich student minds by imbibe the values and
                                        ideals
                                        of MUNs into the student population. We, at the AMIMUN club, will continue to
                                        strive
                                        towards perfection and are proud to be at the forefront of this mission

                                    the
                                    focus on actionable change, something I believe is especially important as it
                                    lays a
                                    clear focus on problem-solving instead of abstract, principled debate. This
                                    focus on
                                    problem-solving is what sets MUNs apart from other activities since MUNs
                                    actively
                                    incentivizes the creation of a wide knowledge base and develops clarity of
                                    action. I
                                    believe MUNs to be intrinsically valuable as an activity for any student looking
                                    to
                                    improve their public speaking skills, knowledge base or their approach towards
                                    solving real-world problems.

                                    Sessions and Intra-MUNs alike. Possessing one of the largest student member
                                    bodies,
                                    the AMIMUN Club has grown leaps and bounds since its inception in 2012. Not only
                                    is
                                    this stellar growth a sign of MUNs being accepted widely among the student body,
                                    but
                                    also of a successful effort to enrich student minds by imbibe the values and
                                    ideals
                                    of MUNs into the student population. We, at the AMIMUN club, will continue to
                                    strive
                                    towards perfection and are proud to be at the forefront of this mission
