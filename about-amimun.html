            ABOUT AMIMUN
        </h2>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p class="body-content">
            Amity International Model United Nations is a simulation of the United Nations spanning over three days. At
            AMIMUN, delegates gain in-depth knowledge of diplomacy, international relations, and the inner workings of
            the United Nations. Currently, in it's Eighth Edition, AMIMUN has set a certain standard for the conduct of
            MUNs throughout the Nation with its innovative themes, focus on pertinent issues and a stellar level of
            debate. Through debating issues that confront world leaders and drafting resolutions, one will enhance their
            critical thinking, public speaking and leadership skills.
            <br>
            Moreover, the combination of the depth of research required and the understanding one must-have of others'
            views and attitudes, due to the interactions with multitudes of other young minds from various backgrounds,
            give the students a deep insight into the real-world problems. They then become aware of the causes of
            conflict between nations which leads them to a better understanding of the interests and motivations of
            others. Thus, AMIMUN follows through with the Preamble to the Charter of the United Nations: "To practise
            tolerance and live together in peace with one another as good neighbours."

            WHY AMIMUN?
        </h2>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p class="body-content">
            ABSOLUTE COMMITMENT : The Secretariat of Amity International Model United Nations Conference consists of
            extremely hard working and knowledgeable individuals who have been carefully selected especially for this
            purpose. They are dedicated and committed to AMIMUN ideals, ensuring smooth running of all the committees
            and providing the delegates with warm hospitality. Delegates who attend our conference, leave with a great
            experience as well as a feeling of satisfaction in their hearts.
            <br>
            INTERNATIONAL PLATFORM : Amity is the leading education group of India with over 1, 00,000 students studying
            across 1000 acres of hi-tech campuses. At Amity, we are passionate about growing leaders who are not only
            thorough professionals but also good human beings. Amity University is amongst the leading technical
            institutions of the country with a distinguished alma mater who have achieved success in various corners of
            the world. Thus, AMIMUN provides a huge international platform to the delegates to interact with individuals
            from different countries and backgrounds. This edition of AMIMUN is being held in association with United
            Nations Information Centre For India and Bhutan (UNIC), collaboration with Médecins Sans Frontières and
            collaboration with Amnesty International India. AMIMUN'19 is recognised by United Nations.
            <br>
            CREATIVE AND INNOVATIVE : We here at AMIMUN believe in innovation, and supporting this idea in this edition
            of AMIMUN we have 8 committees which span a wide range of agendas and deliberation while keeping our theme
            “Dèbat. Discuter. Dècider.” intact with our committees. These committees, whilst bringing freshness and
            higher levels of enthusiasm to the conference, also ensure that delegates get a chance not only to hone
            their speaking skills but also to practice innovation. At AMIMUN’19, we intend to build a platform that not
            only distinguishes us from every other MUN, but also helps us create a benchmark for the editions to come.
