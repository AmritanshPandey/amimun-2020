                            from the moment I started college, it wouldn't be unfair to say that AMIMUN has been my

                            courage to speak, changes the world. MUNs are nothing but an apt explanation of the same.
                            With an approach to diplomacy and the determination to sustain peacekeeping globally, these
                            simulations of the United Nations Diaspora have the exact same impact on a young diplomat’s
                            mind.<br>
                            AMIMUN has been an integral part of my life and today when I look down the road I have
                            travelled, I give a major credit to AMIMUN for paving that path.
                            AMIMUN’19 cannot make me less enthused about world class debating with respect to global
                            peacekeeping and I’m honoured to be a part of the advisory board for the conference. I
                            encourage young orators to be a part of AMIMUN’19 and take advantage of the learning
                            opportunities that it will provide.</p>

                            no looking back. I consider it an honor to be a part of AMIMUN'19 as an Advisor. I'm really
                            proud how AMIMUN has become a legacy which has always strived to introduce new ideas, in the
                            form of unconventional committees, which in turn open up an entirely new side of role-based
                            debating. I've been associated with AMIMUN as a delegate, as the Secretary General in 2014,
                            a member of the Executive Board, and as a member of the Advisory Panel, and thus, I can
                            confidently say that AMIMUN has been growing with each year, ever since its inception. I'm
                            really excited about AMIMUN'19 as I'm confident this MUN is going to be an absolutely
                            delightful experience for everyone. Cheers!</p>

                            century, the list of issues that plague nations has risen simultaneously. The nature of
                            conflicts has changed from being among nations to being within nations. Economies have
                            become the bedrock of the world, their rise and fall affecting the quality of life the world
                            over. In this moment, United Nations holds immense significance as the source of
                            negotiations and deliberations upon such issues. I’ve been associated with AMIMUN since 2013
                            and I consider it an honour to be a part of AMIMUN’19 as an advisor. It gives me immense
                            pleasure inviting you all to be a part of AMIMUN’19 to witness the most extravagant
                            conference of the year. AMIMUN conferences are unique for providing an international
                            atmosphere for delegates with a variety of experience. The secretariat and the organising
                            committee are constantly setting higher standards to make every year even more exciting and
                            challenging for both new and returning delegates. I look forward to this magnanimous

                            beginnings in 2011. Delegates from all over India and abroad, will engage in well-directed
                            debates in any one of our seven committees which are being simulated this year. I expect
                            AMIMUN 2019 to leave a lasting impression on your hearts and minds long after the conference
                            comes to an end. It is indeed my honour and privilege to welcome you all to the 8th edition
                            of Amity International Model United Nations Conference, 2019.</p>

                            world is integrated and why it is indispensable to work in coordination amidst Nations. It’s
                            been 4 years that I have fastened myself with AMIMUN and discerning the growth I can assure
                            delegates, this year also it is going to set new standards and benchmarks. I feel prodigious
                            being the advisor of AMIMUN’19 and on behalf of AMIMUN family I would like to invite all the
                            delegates to partake in the conference and experience how influential MUNs can be to
                            scintillate consequential dialogues and notions.</p>

                            than ever. And this is where MUN helps the students, it gives them a platform which helps
                            them learn about world issues and voice their opinions and become more globally concerned
                            citizens. MUN helps you build leadership skills, diplomatic skills, confidence and most of
                            all it enhances your public speaking skills.<br>
                            I have been a part of the AMIMUN conference since 2014 and I feel privileged to be part
                            AMIMUN'19 as an advisor. I can easily say that this is one of the best conference not only
                            in the Delhi circuit but in the country as well. The hospitality, logistics, everything is
                            marked to perfection at AMIMUN and it gets better with every passing year. Finally the level
                            of debate which you will experience at AMIMUN will make you want to come back again next
                            year. I am eagerly looking forward to this phenomenal conference.</p>

                            country in a truly international and multicultural environment, debating over hot topics of
                            the current geopolitical agenda, learning to negotiate and compromise to reach consensus,
                            making new friends. No one needs to be a professional of the international relations, or on
                            diplomacy, it is all about learning. Today you might be delegates in your College, you're
                            learning, getting familiar with the concept, its rules, but who knows maybe tomorrow you
                            will be sitting in New-York or Geneva at the UN's headquarters, small steps guide you to
                            higher places. AMIMUN'19 is your opportunity to learn how to be a delegate and to feel the
                            atmosphere of a MUN. Being helped, supported and surrounded by the AMITY team, which this
                            year is organizing its 8th MUN but also boosted by Indonesia MUN, Young Leaders' Consortium

                            youth to understand how the world works and deals with its problems. We cannot, as future
                            world leaders, suggest to build walls as solutions to security threats. We must, instead,
                            find ways to, if not resolve, then at least to endure them together by building bridges and
                            forging lasting and incorruptible relationships. Let's focus on resolving issues that will
                            be discussed over the duration of the conference instead of going back and forth with cause
                            and effect for an unwarranted period of time. I am confident that AMIMUN will prove to be a
                            fine example of the youth's capability to influence and bring about change, as it always has
                            been. I look forward to watching AMIMUN achieve new milestones and setting examples for all
                            other institutions to follow.</p>

                            young minds broaden their perspectives on real world issues that need our attention TODAY. I
                            have been associated with AMIMUN since 2014 and before it, I was ignorant to how powerful a
                            medium it can be to spark important discussions and ideas. Since its conception, it has
                            grown every year to become bigger and better. It has always realized the importance of
                            difficult conversations and unconventional committees. I feel honored to be on the advisory
                            panel of AMIMUN'19, and hope that it continues to strive to make a real difference.</p>
