                            issues and conflict resolution, Amity University is organizing the Amity International Model
                            United Nations (AMIMUN'20) from the 17th to the 19th of January, 2020 and will host
                            brilliant minds from leading institutions. It is a conference that will provide a practical
                            learning environment, the benefits of which can be significant in the journey of
                            participating students who aspire to become leaders who will impact society in a positive
                            way.<br>



                            AMIMUN'20 will be a platform for the growth of the youth. As the leaders of tomorrow unite
                            at this conference, they will hone their skills in leadership, teamwork, expository and
                            persuasive writing, debating and negotiations, and learn the significance of these skills
                            for personal development and a successful future.<br>



                            I welcome the distinguished guests at AMIMUN'20 and am certain that they will serve as role
                            models for the students participating in the Conference. The vast experience and inspiration
                            expressed in their words will help the delegates realize the significance of skills such as
                            strategic thinking and critical analysis as well as the importance of positivity, humility,
                            and compassion in their journey to make a real difference in the world.<br>



                            Owing to the efforts of the dedicated members of the organizing committee and the team of
                            assiduous students, AMIMUN'20 promises to be a conference of high repute. I extend my best
                            wishes for AMIMUN'20 to be a resounding success.<br>

                            quality education through a progressive approach, and expanding the horizons of knowledge,
                            Amity presents AMIMUN'20 as a means to encourage interaction among students from across the
                            globe and provide them the opportunity to take part in diplomatic discussions on compelling
                            issues. I am delighted to welcome you to the ninth edition of the Amity International Model
                            United Nations Conference to be held from January 17 - 19, 2020 at Amity University,
                            Noida.<br>

                            Since its inception in 2011, AMIMUN has helped participants to witness the extreme relevance
                            of learning international affairs and understanding the working and significance of the
                            United Nations. Peace-making, security, conflict prevention, social progress, better living
                            standards and human rights are some of the numerous aspects that are emphasized to the youth
                            at AMIMUN.<br>

                            The theme for AMIMUN'20 is 'Audere est Facere', to ensure that the youth take charge and
                            become leaders of tomorrow. At this international conference, we aim to expose students to a
                            global perspective through a spark that will stir nations to come together and create a
                            world where we find innovation and peaceful co-existence going hand in hand. This MUN will
                            be a unique convention, with a multiplicity of delegates from various Institutions, which
                            will give birth to a new generation of strong, confident and, above all, compassionate
                            leaders.<br>

                            I take this opportunity to convey my best wishes to the delegates and wish them a great
                            learning experience as well as a pleasant stay at our campus. I am certain that the hard
                            work and commitment of the organizing committee members and the Secretariat will make
                            AMIMUN'20 a glorious success!

                            worldwide recognition and its status as one of the top MUNs across the continent with
                            the
                            participation of delegates from across the world.<br>

                            AMIMUN has focused on issues that have been globally relevant to each time period,
                            consistently staying in accordance with the goals of the United Nations. It allows each
                            participant to display their skills as debaters, photographers, reporters,
                            administrators and good
                            leaders while simultaneously providing them with an enriching intellectual experience.<br>
                            By following the theme for AMIMUN'20 ‘Audere est facere' which is Latin for ‘To Dare is

                            Do', we wish to encourage the delegates to engage in debate that is thought-provoking
                            and will
                            yield forth solutions to the pressing issues in the world today. In the current scenario

                            speak louder than words. Thus, it is when the youth begins to take bold decisions, that
                            humanity
                            itself progresses.<br>
                            AMIMUN'20 is sure to be an amalgamation of riveting debate, individual growth and
                            revolutionary ideas, helping delegates move closer to becoming the policymakers of
                            tomorrow. It
                            is my belief that AMIMUN'20 will be a resounding success with the diligent efforts put
                            by the
                            Secretariat and the Organizing Committee of AMIMUN'20.<br>

                            dynamic Chancellor, Dr. Atul Chauhan and the guiding force behind AMIMUN's successful
                            Legacy , Respected Vice Chancellor, Prof. (Dr.) Balvinder Shukla, for providing

                            the
